## 📖 API Reference

### `isHoliday(date: Date): boolean`

Check if the given date is a holiday (including weekends and public holidays).

holiday.isHoliday(new Date('2022-10-01')) // true - National Day
holiday.isHoliday(new Date('2022-10-08')) // true - Weekend (Saturday)
```

### `isWorkday(date: Date): boolean`

Check if the given date is a workday.

```js
holiday.isWorkday(new Date('2022-10-10')) // false - National Day holiday period
holiday.isWorkday(new Date('2022-10-11')) // true - Regular workday
```

### `isPublicHoliday(date: Date): boolean`

Check if the given date is an official public holiday (excluding regular weekends).

```js
holiday.isPublicHoliday(new Date('2022-10-01')) // true - National Day
holiday.isPublicHoliday(new Date('2022-10-08')) // false - Regular weekend
```

### `isPublicWorkday(date: Date): boolean`
